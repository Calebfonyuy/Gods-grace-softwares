		<div  id="abstract">
			<p>There is the continuous increase in the use of computers and ICT tools in our society today making it necessary for people to stay updated with these technologies. We are expected to be able to use the new feature being added to our telephones and computers on almost daily basis and to use them to maximum possible. However, to and extend we will not be able to make the most out of these unless we are able understand certain basic principles about the computer and related ICT tools. It is quite clear that in a country like ours, Cameroon, computer illiteracy is still an issue. It should be noted that being able to do some few tasks on the computer is not enough but it is also necessary to understand what you do and why you do it that way.</p>
			<p>It is therefore in this light that <abbr>GGS</abbr> sets out to bring to you these lessons so that you can be able to have the necessary understanding of what you use and then be able to make the most out of it.</p>
			<p>We count on your best wishes and feedback to keep this site updated and to correct whatever errors that we may have made.</p>
