                All the above stated facts are very true. Now, the question is how one can make use of these facts to keep his computer healthier and make it stay longer. Even if you have never been attacked by a computer virus either coming from the internet or from a friends USB drive, you should know that it is not a good experience. It can often lead to formatting of you entire system and the loss of part or all your data. <br>
                We will look into some ways in which we can make use of the above facts in order to keep our computers safe without having to greatly spend on expensive antivirus programs. Simply do the following:
                
                <ul class="advice-steps">
                    <li>
                        <b>Partition your hard drive into at least two drives</b><br>
                        These two drives include the <em>Drive C</em> and some other drive say <em>Drive D</em>. With this configuration, you can use drive D to save your files which are hence more safe against virus infection and can still be kept in case you need to change or reinstall your windows operating system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Add a strong password to your administrator account</b><br>
                        A strong password will keep your computer safe and make sure that you properly identify and authorise all administrative tasks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Create a limited account where you will do most if not all your computer work</b><br>
                        As we stated above, software need administrator rights in order to get installed or to perform certain tasks. Viruses, worms and trojans are also software (otherwise known as malware) and more often than not will need authorisation in order to get installed. When you work in your administrator account, it makes it much easier for these programs to override administrative authority. It is therefore advisable to work from a limited account so as to prevent this. With this, you will need to explicitly invoke administrative rights for all these activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Carefully organize your files in the Drive D</b><br>
                        Do you remember the last time you were looking for that project report you accidentally saved in the music folder instead of the documents folder? You will bear with me that it was not an activity you will want to have it repeat itself.<br>
                        Now, you will create as many folders as are relevant in this drive so that each file is being saved in the right place. For example, a high school science student will create folders like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Biology</li>
                            <li>Physics</li>
                            <li>Computer Science</li>
                            <li>Music</li>
                            <li>Pictures</li>
                            <li>Mathematics</li>
                        </ul>
                        By so doing, you will know exactly where what ever you saved is found and would not always go round searching when you need a file. Your mathematics notes and assignments will all be together as well as those pictures you took at the beach with your friends.<br>
                        It is worth noting that it is not enough to create the folders but it is also necessary to be disciplined to save everything in the right place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Avoid wastage of disk space</b><br>
                        Do not save duplicate files in your disks. Rather create shortcuts at various points where you think you will want to access the file or folder and let the file stay in the right folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Always keep setup files of the software you install</b><br>
                        It is obvious that if you downloaded these, you will tend to think that it is no problem going back there to download the programs again when you need them. What happens if you have to format your computer and reinstall your operating system? You wouldn't want to go online and start downloading the over 15 softwares that you have been using. Hence, it is advisable to keep at least the setups of those you consider as being important.
