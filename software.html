				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>Computer software is a collection of programs which provides instructions telling the computer what to do. In simple terms, we can consider software as simply a set of instructions which direct the hardware to accomplish a task. Examples of software include <em>Microsoft Office Word, Adobe Photoshop</em> etc. The latter are able to tell the computer to do something. Adobe Photoshop for example will tell the computer how to change some properties of picture.</p>
				<p>There are various types of software classified according their various functions. The two main classes of software are <b>System software and application software</b>. These are further classified into more specific groups depending on the type of task accomplished by each of the software.</p>

			<section id="system">
				<h4>System Software</h4>
				<p>When we talk of system software, we are referring to software which is designed to direct the functioning of the hardware and provide a base on which application software runs. This software has the ability to communicate directly with the physical components of the computer(hardware) passing to the latter tasks to be accomplished.</p>
				<p>As relates to their interaction with <a href="#application">application software</a>, system software serve like a ground layer on which these applications run. This is because application software do not have the capability to communicate directly with the hardware. They therefore rely on system software in order to send and receive information from the hardware.</p>
				<p>Software considered as system software include <b>Operating systems and all utility software.</b> Examples of operating systems include <em>Windows NT, Windows 10, Linux, Unix, OS\2, MacOS, Chrome OS etc</em> Utility software refers to software whose tasks are related to the analysis, configuration, optimization and/or maintenance of the computer system. Examples of utility programs include <em>various types of antivirus software, backup software, compression utilities, debuggers, BIOS, boot loader etc</em></p>

				<h4>Application Software</h4>
				<p>Application software are software created to help the computer user accomplish more specific tasks. They are usually much easier to use and easy to learn. Application software can be classified into the following classes depending on the tasks they achieve:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h6>Word processors</h6>
						<p>These are programs which can be used to create, edit, format, store and print out textual documents. They are the successors of the the orinal typewriter machine and make the creation of documents much easier. Examples include <b>Microsoft Office word, LibreOffice Writer, Google Docs,Apple TextEdit etc.</b></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Spreadsheet software</h6>
						<p>These are software capable of managing large amounts of data represented on spreadsheets commonly in numerical form. They are equipped with formulas and methods for performing various types of operations on the data such as plotting graphs,creating comments etc. Examples include <b>Microsoft Office Excel, Google sheets, LibreOffice Calc, Lotus 1-2-3 etc</b></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Database Management Software (DBMS)</h6>
						<p>A database is an organized collection of data for easy sorting, querrying, maintenance and updating. A DBMS is simply a software which has been created with the ability to manage such data collections. The offer means for computer users to conviniently manage large units of data. Examples of such software include <b>MySQL,Oracle Database, Microsoft Office Access etc</b></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Desktop Publishing Software</h6>
						<p>These are software which are used to create graphics for both desktop and publishing purposes. They can be used to create images, various types of cards, banners etc. Examples of such software include <b>Adobe PageMaker, Adobe Photoshop, MS Publisher etc</b></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Internet browsers</h6>
						<p>Browsers are one of the most common software in this era of information and communication technologies. They are simply computer programs that permit us to view web pages, read emails as well as access other online resources. The most commonly used browser nowadays on computers is <b>Google Chrome browser.</b> Other examples of browsers include <b>Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, UC Mini broser, Opera Browser etc</b></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Presentation Software</h6>
						<p>These are software used to create multimedia presentations like slideshows, powerpoints etc. Examples include MS PowerPoint, Hyper Studio etc</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h6>Others</h6>
						<p>Apart form the above mentioned major classes of application software, there exist other classes like <b><i>Sound editing software, picture editing software, Integrated Development Environments(IDEs)</i></b> which are used for software production and a bunch many other types of software.</p>
						<p>It is worth noting that given the current state of our world, we can find software being used in every domain of life. It can therefore sometimes make sense to talk about classes of software as related to the domains of life where they are being used.</p>
