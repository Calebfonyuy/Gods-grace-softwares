        <h2>Why the idea of this site?</h2>

        <p>I remember back in the days when i was in secondary school and took my first laptop to school. I was asked all sorts of questions ranging from how to do this or the other with the computer to what the various parts were for and how to use them. This really made me realise that there were a lot of youths who did not yet have the basic knowledge on the use of computers. In addition to this, throughout my life in school and in the community, i noticed that a lot of youths presented some interest in learning to use computers as well as knowing more about them but did not really have access to required knowledge on how to use them. In addition, computer lessons usually offered in various secretariats for beginners are usually very expensive and shallow.</p>
        <p>In addition, as i moved on up till university level, i still came accross teens and even adults who do not have this knowledge and a number of them seeking the knowledge but unable to get it.</p>
        <p>It is therefore in this light that i came up with the idea of building a website where i could make available the so much desired knowledge with practical examples and solid explainations. I believe that any beginner going through this site will not regret it and will have every reason to recommend it to his or her mates.</p>
        <p>In a country like Cameroon where i am based, i believe that we still have a long way to go with the tranmission and acquisition of knowledge on the use of computers and associated accessories so as to boast the development of the technological sector of the country. This site therfore comes as a useful resource to making this development to be realized.</p>
